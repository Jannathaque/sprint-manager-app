# sprint-manager-app
A simple full-stack web application designed to help Agile teams log sprint goals and retrospective notes. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and deployed-ready for AWS EC2 or Render. This project reflects my transition from Agile project management into hands-on software engineering and full-stack development.
